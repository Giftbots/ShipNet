But how can a captain accurately identify whether a shape on the ocean horizon is a dangerous destroyer or an innocent container ship? That's where **ShipNet** comes in.\n","\n","Even if you're not a ship's captain, have you ever felt the need to distinguish a tanker from aircraft carrier, or a cruise ship from a cargo ship? Do you know nothing about ships but have a burning desire to astound to your ship-spotting acquaintances?\n","\n","You're in luck! With **ShipNet**, confusion in ship identification is a thing of the past. Simply upload an image of a large ship, and **ShipNet** will predict whether it is one of the following types:\n","1. Aircraft Carrier\n","2. Destroyer\n","3. Container ship\n","4. Tanker\n","5. Cruise ship\n","\n","Note: ShipNet works best with colour photos of ships taken at a distance on the open sea. ShipNet is only able to accurately classify ships belonging to one of the five types listed above. \n","\n","Note^2: Please do not abuse ShipNet with images that do not contain ships - it has feelings too."]}]}
